It is well recognised that things are not always what they seem. For example, on Earth, man had always presumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much - the wheel, wars, and so on - whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about having a great time. However, the dolphins had always been confident that they were far more intelligent than man - for exactly the same reasons. 
Curiously, the dolphins had known of the impending destruction of the Earth for a long time and had made numerous attempts to alert mankind to the danger; but most of their attempts at communication were misinterpreted as amusing efforts to punch footballs or whistle for snacks, so they ultimately gave up and left the Earth shortly before the Vogons reached the planet. 
The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly complex attempt to do a double-backwards-somersault through a ring whilst whistling the "Star-Spangled Banner", but in fact the message was, "So Long, and thanks for all the fish."
In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dolphins, and they spent much of their time in behavioural research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting experiments on man. The fact that man completely misunderstood this relationship was wholly according to these creatures' plans.
