It is important to note that everything is not always what it seems. 
Man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins, because man felt that he had achieved so much more - the wheel, fire, computers... whilst dolphins only ever seemed to mess about in the water. Dolphins, however, believed that they were much more intelligent than man for exactly the same reasons. 
It is interesting to note that dolphins had been aware of the destruction of the Earth for quite some time before the Vogons arrived. In the months leading up to it they had spent some time attempting to communicate the danger, but with no success. Ultimately, they left the Earth of their own accord a few days before its destruction, with one last message to the humans that was interpreted as an ambitious attempt to whistle the American national anthem whilst performing a double back flip. The message was, in fact, "So long and thanks for all the fish."
There was only one species on Earth more intelligent than the dolphins, but so far neither man nor dolphin had recognised this as they had spent the majority of their time conducting incredibly subtle experiments on man whilst apparently running through mazes and round small wheels.
