It should be noted that everything is not always what it appears. 
For example, humans believe that they are more intelligent than dolphins, and they are certain that they have the facts to support this belief - for instance the wheel, and New York - whilst dolphins have very little to show for their time in the world other than having a good time in the water and the opportunity to consume a significant quantity of fish. Dolphins, on the other hand, hold precisely the opposite opinion, for precisely the same reasons. 
Of course, the fact that the dolphins had known for a long time about the Vogon fleet, the hyperspace bypass, and the Earth's impending destruction did support their argument. In fact, they had spent a significant amount of time attempting to communicate this impending obliteration to the humans, but had failed to achieve anything beyond an increased supply of fish. In the end, they whistled a grateful goodbye which could be translated - had humanity got the hang of that - as "So long and thanks for all the fish", but was actually understood to be an attempt to whistle the "Star Spangled Banner" whilst performing a complex and unnecessary double somersault out of the water. 
In fact, on Earth there is only one species who is cleverer than dolphins, but so far they have cunningly managed to avoid revealing themselves by performing incredibly subtle experiments on the humans whilst apparently simply running round wheels and up and down small tubes.
