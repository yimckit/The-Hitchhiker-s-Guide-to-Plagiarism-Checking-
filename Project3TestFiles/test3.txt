It is vital to be aware that everything is not always what it appears. 
Humans had always assumed that they were cleverer than dolphins, because they believed that they had obviously achieved much more - the wheel, for example, whilst dolphins only ever seemed to play around in the sea. Dolphins, however, were quite convinced that they were more intelligent than man for exactly the same reasons. 
It is worth noting that dolphins had been aware of Earth's impending destruction for quite a while before the Vogon fleet appeared. During this time they had put notable effort into communicating the danger, but had ultimately failed. Finally, they left the Earth by their own means a few days before it was destroyed, with one last message to the humans. On this occasion, their message was interpreted as an impressive attempt to whistle the American national anthem whilst performing a double backwards somersault, though the message was, actually, "So long and thanks for all the fish."
Only one species on Earth was actually more intelligent than the dolphins, though neither man nor dolphin was aware of this as they had typically spent their time conducting incomprehensibly delicate experiments on man whilst apparently running round in small wheels.
